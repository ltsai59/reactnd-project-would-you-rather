# Would you rather

This is a web application that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”.  

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of how Redux works in a React-based web app.

This application is the second of the three projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
